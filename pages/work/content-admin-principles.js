    problem: 'Admins often get the short end of the stick and yet they power the content platforms for all of the media we consume. Part of the reason that internal tooling gets shorted is in the service of accelerating end user value by putting most development resources into the user-facing product and infrastructure.',
    value: `By focusing on creating a great experience for content administrators, we can drive user value by making the platform fully serviceable by its admin. Further, with upfront investment on internal tooling for each shipped project, we'll increase build velocity in the long run, increasing user value.`

In software development, this is not always the case. A need to rush to market creates a “just make it work” mentality. Things are hacked in ad hoc. Patches are applied to tears. Eventually, however, as the application scales, it begins to come apart at the seams. The patches wither. The tears become irreparable holes. Details in the deck:`,
