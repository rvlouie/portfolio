    problem: 'Splice Sounds had no metadata interconnectedness. It was the Converse Rubber Tracks metadata issue all over again x 100. Further, tech debt around this had brought certain queries to a crawl. The only mitigation was through search infrastructure.',
    value: 'Besides tech debt, construction an ontology/knowledge graph would bring tons of user value, allowing the company to reason about the world of recorded music and its relation to the product offering. It would also provide tools that would allow designers and PMs to create n products from the graph, and to fold in machine learning.'

  description__intro: "When the project was green-lit, there really wasn't anything like it in the music space. There were some comps to learn from, like stock image sites and Beatport, but each of those came with a caveatâ€”for example, with stock image sites there was lack of personalization; and with Beatport, while it had robust organizing principles, for musical content categorization it was based in full tracks and musical genres instead of musical component sounds.",
