  description__intro: `In August of 2018 we decided to run a Google Venture design sprint around "Artist Identity." Besides learning that it is a bad idea to both be the facilitator, do the recruit, implement the prototype and run the user interviews, myself and the team learned a lot.`,
  description__intro2: `Our stated long term goal was: "Represent content so that providers feel empowered and consumers feel inspired." We wanted to add an authentic value to both sides of the 2 sided marketplace. Here's a summary:`,

  description__intro3: `We wound up building and prototyping new content pages that used content created by the artist themselves to tell a story.`,

  description__listIntro: `While interviewing users on the last day we learned a few key things:`,
  list__artistSprint: [
    `People are inspired by stories about how content is made, so show don't tell.`,
    `Artists want to tell the story behind their work and producers are eager to hear it.`,
    `The features that hit the hardest were telling the story of an artists process, rather than a story of the artist themselves.`
  ],
  description__dillaIntro: `Acutely, we were launching a campaign with J Dilla that was time sensitive. It seemed like a good time to push a slightly larger in scope project and inject some of our learnings from the artist sprint into the product. Our solution was, of course, story pages.`,
  image__dillaPage: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dmizjakby/image/upload/v1563203608/portfolio/stories/pio58o9ccsxdoh3qt2vj.png',
  description__dilla1: `I had presented several concepts for handling story telling on packs pages, from a video in the header, to a modal experience, through putting stories on their own page. My preferred design solution was to put the story on its own page and also create a model in the database that wasn't tethered exclusively to packs so that the module could be reused in the future; this approach had broad cross-functional consensus.`,
  desciption__dilla2: `A particular challenge with this design was the navigation and sense of place between the main pack, story and companion packs. Another designer and I collaborated on the IA and visual design.`,
  image__navigationFlow: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dmizjakby/image/upload/v1563203607/portfolio/stories/oscqgzlpfk5rrmrc28kq.png',

  description__companionPack: `We opted for context headers on the story and the companion packs that lead you back to the main pack. And each companion pack could lead you to another companion pack.`,

  description__packsConclusion: `On story pages, companion packs have their own module, closing the loop.`,
  description__conclusion: `Implementation and launch of this feature went very smoothly. I attribute this to involving a large portion of the team in the original sprint, iterating off of the work done during the sprint, getting early cross-functional consensus around the feature to be built for a specific campaign, and an effective design collaboration that afforded multiple sets of eyes on the nitty gritty details.`,

    learnings: [
      `Companion packs and stories are now regularly used by the content and marketing teams to tell narratives around content.`,
      `GV sprints are 100% worth the week of time if you can afford to block out half an iteration with your team.`,
      `I think that companion packs should also link back to the main story. There was a missed opportunity to further fortify the relationship between the story and the companion packs.`,
      `Due to some tech debt, this feature is logged in only. A next iteration should be available logged out so that we can drive user sign ups through a CTA and drive more SEO value for the entire platform. This problem is compounded because it's not the greatest experience to have to go one click in from a pack to get to its story, ideally we should drive people directly to the story.`,
      `Stories should be expanded beyond packs and be attachable to any piece of content across the Splice platform (and in turn have any piece of Splice content attachable to a story), and added to the ontology. Long tail, stories can replace the external blog and bring editorial in-house.`,
      `Companion packs were built bespoke for one purpose where in the data model companion packs must have a parent pack. This should be abstracted out so that arbitrary packs can be grouped agnostic to hierarchy (for example, multiple volumes in a pack series).`,
